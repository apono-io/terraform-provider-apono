# Data Source: apono_access_scopes (beta)

Retrieves existing Apono Access Scopes. This data source can be used to feed existing access scopes into the Access Flow resource.

## Example Usage

### Retrieve All Access Scopes

```terraform
data "apono_access_scopes" "access-scopes-list" {
}
```

### Retrieve a Specific Access Scope by Exact Name

```terraform
data "apono_access_scopes" "production_db" {
  name = "Production Database Access"
}
```

### Retrieve Access Scopes Matching a Pattern

```terraform
data "apono_access_scopes" "production_scopes" {
  name = "*Production*"
}
```

Example usage of [`production_db`](../resources/access_flow_v2.md#bundle-and-access-scope-as-access-targets) used in an access flow.

By specifying a wildcard pattern `*Production*`, all access scopes with a name that contains Production are returned. We then output the total count of those access scopes.
